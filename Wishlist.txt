His feeling is that there is diminishing returns on RF as the gun already has 85 Aim Assist. The Fastdraw HCS sight has a +15 Handling improvement that he says is "no joke." Perpetual Motion (stability, handling and reload buffs) is great because you are always moving and the perk is almost always up.

//Heating Up, Snapshot Sites
dimwishlist:item=4164201232&perks=1570042021,957782887#notes:Source:Coolguy Tag:PVP Heating Up This is a bit of hidden god roll.  Heating up x1 = 15% Accuracy Cone Growth + 15 Stability and + 15 Recoil Direction.  X2 = 30,30,30. Even at x1 it's better than opening shot (+10% accuracy) which doesn't drop on this weapon.  Look for Arrowhead Brake or Fluted Barrel in the barrel slot and Accurized Rounds or Tactical Mag for the magazine.
//Quick Draw, Snapshot Sites

Look for Arrowhead Brake or Fluted Barrel in the barrel slot and Accurized Rounds or Tactical Mag for the magazine.
